# WhatWouldYouDoForADollar_v0.1

This web app could be considered a "service sharing hub" (I am struggling to put it into words). The idea is that users can browse through a list of tasks that other users are willing to pay others to complete. Tasks can vary in difficulty and the reward is completely up to the task owner. 

With this app, the posting user can offer anything they want as the reward; it does not have to be monetary. 

As it stands now, the app is only using a local SQLite database, but will eventually move to SQLAlchemy or something else.

Eventually, there will be a way to view each user's profile that can show how many tasks they have completed and posted. I want to implement a points system so users can level up as they use the app.
